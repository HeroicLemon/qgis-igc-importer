name=GPX Segment Importer
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=This plugin imports an GPX file and creates short line segments between the track points
version=2.5
author=Simon Gröchenig @ Salzburg Research
email=simon.groechenig@salzburgresearch.at

about=This plugin imports an GPX file and creates short line segments between the track points. Features include:
    * Available as QGIS dialog in toolbar and also as QGIS algorithm for usage in processing
    * [dialog, algorithm] Read all attributes available from each track point at the segment start and/or end. This includes the timestamp and the elevation as well as any other attributes added to a track point.
    * [dialog] Select one or multiple GPX files with the same data structure at once.
    * [dialog] To gain full control over the data, you can edit the attribute table before creating the segment layer. You can exclude attributes, modify the attribute label and change the data type (integer, double, boolean or string) if the automatic type detection failed, e.g. at numeric data that contains “Null” or “None” values. Also, the plugin detects empty attributes and excludes it by default.
    * [dialog, algorithm] Optionally calculate motion attributes (track points indices, distance, speed, duration and elevation_diff) between track points.
    * [algorithm] Second algorithm 'Track segment creator' to apply line segment creator to any point vector dataset that has a timestamp attribute.
